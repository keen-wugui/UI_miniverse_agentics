- On `@iterate-html` for a selected HTML snippet, produce **Version 1**, **Version 2**, and **Version 3**, each separated by `<!-- Version X -->`.  
- Prompt: “Which version would you like to refine?”  
- When the user replies with “Version N”, take that version and generate three new refined variants labeled **N.1**, **N.2**, **N.3**.  
- Preserve original semantics and improve accessibility (e.g., ARIA attributes) on each refinement.
