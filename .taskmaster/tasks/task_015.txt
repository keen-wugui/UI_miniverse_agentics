# Task ID: 15
# Title: Performance Optimization and Caching Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations and caching strategies throughout the application for improved user experience.
# Details:
1. Configure React Query caching strategies for different data types
2. Implement optimistic updates for common operations
3. Add lazy loading for components and routes
4. Create virtualized lists for large data sets using react-window or similar
5. Implement image optimization using Next.js Image component
6. Add memoization for expensive computations
7. Create efficient re-rendering strategies using React.memo and useMemo
8. Implement code splitting for large components
9. Add prefetching for likely user paths
10. Create service worker for offline support
11. Implement bundle optimization techniques
12. Add performance monitoring and reporting

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure and compare performance before and after optimizations
2. Test caching behavior with various scenarios
3. Verify optimistic updates functionality
4. Test lazy loading and code splitting
5. Validate virtualized lists with large data sets
6. Measure bundle sizes and load times
7. Test offline support with service worker
8. Validate performance in different browsers and devices

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement React Query Caching Strategies and Optimistic Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize data fetching and state management using React Query's caching capabilities and implement optimistic updates for improved user experience.
### Details:
1. Configure proper cacheTime and staleTime for different query types
2. Implement query invalidation strategies for data consistency
3. Set up optimistic updates for form submissions and data mutations
4. Add prefetching for anticipated user actions
5. Implement background data refreshing
6. Measure improvements using React Query Devtools and performance metrics (Time to Interactive, API call frequency)
7. Document caching strategy decisions and their impact

## 2. Optimize Components with Lazy Loading, Memoization, and Code Splitting [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Improve component rendering performance through strategic implementation of React optimization techniques.
### Details:
1. Identify and implement React.lazy() for route-based code splitting
2. Apply React.memo() to prevent unnecessary re-renders in appropriate components
3. Implement useMemo and useCallback hooks for expensive calculations and callback functions
4. Set up dynamic imports for large components and libraries
5. Use React Profiler to identify and fix render bottlenecks
6. Measure and document performance improvements (component render times, bundle size reduction)
7. Create guidelines for future component optimization

## 3. Implement List Virtualization and Image Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Optimize rendering of large lists and image loading to reduce memory usage and improve perceived performance.
### Details:
1. Implement react-window or react-virtualized for long scrollable lists
2. Set up lazy loading for off-screen images using Intersection Observer
3. Implement proper image sizing and responsive images
4. Configure image compression and modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
5. Add blur-up or skeleton loading states for images
6. Measure improvements in memory usage, scroll performance, and Largest Contentful Paint
7. Document virtualization strategy and image optimization techniques

## 4. Optimize Service Worker and Bundle Size [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Implement service worker strategies and reduce bundle size to improve application load time and offline capabilities.
### Details:
1. Configure service worker for offline access to critical resources
2. Implement cache strategies (stale-while-revalidate, cache-first) for different asset types
3. Set up tree-shaking and dead code elimination
4. Analyze and reduce bundle size using webpack-bundle-analyzer
5. Implement code splitting at the route level
6. Configure proper cache headers and CDN settings
7. Measure improvements in Lighthouse scores, bundle size, and load times
8. Document service worker strategy and bundle optimization techniques
