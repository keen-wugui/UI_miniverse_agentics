# Subtasks:
## 1. System Performance Metrics Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement visualizations for system performance metrics including CPU usage, memory utilization, response times, and throughput.
### Details:
Data Requirements: Connect to system monitoring APIs to collect real-time and historical performance data. Visualization Specifications: Create line charts for time-series data, gauge charts for current utilization, and heat maps for identifying performance bottlenecks. Interaction Details: Allow users to hover for detailed metrics, zoom in/out on time periods, and set threshold alerts.

## 2. Document Processing and Collection Analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop analytics visualizations for document processing workflows, including ingestion rates, processing times, and collection statistics.
### Details:
Data Requirements: Integrate with document database to extract metadata on document counts, processing status, and collection growth. Visualization Specifications: Implement stacked bar charts for document types, funnel charts for processing stages, and tables for detailed document metadata. Interaction Details: Enable filtering by document type, date ranges, and processing status with drill-down capabilities.

## 3. Business Metrics Dashboard with Time Range Selection [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create a comprehensive business metrics dashboard with flexible time range selection for KPI monitoring and business performance analysis.
### Details:
Data Requirements: Connect to business data sources for revenue, user engagement, conversion rates, and other KPIs. Visualization Specifications: Design card views for key metrics, comparison charts for period-over-period analysis, and composite visualizations for related metrics. Interaction Details: Implement date range picker with presets (day, week, month, quarter, year), comparison toggle, and export functionality.

## 4. Custom Dashboard with Configurable Widgets [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Implement a customizable dashboard framework allowing users to add, remove, resize, and configure visualization widgets based on their needs.
### Details:
Data Requirements: Create a widget configuration schema and storage mechanism for saving user preferences. Visualization Specifications: Develop a widget library with various chart types, data tables, and metric displays. Interaction Details: Enable drag-and-drop widget placement, resizing handles, widget settings panel, and dashboard layout persistence.

## 5. Trend Analysis and Anomaly Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Implement advanced analytics capabilities for identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies in the collected data.
### Details:
Data Requirements: Integrate with statistical analysis libraries and historical data repositories. Visualization Specifications: Create trend line overlays, confidence interval bands, anomaly highlighting, and forecasting projections. Interaction Details: Allow users to adjust sensitivity parameters, select detection algorithms, receive anomaly alerts, and investigate detected patterns through interactive exploration.
