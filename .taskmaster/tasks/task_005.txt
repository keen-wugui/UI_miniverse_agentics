# Task ID: 5
# Title: Health Monitoring Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a comprehensive health monitoring dashboard that aggregates data from all health-related endpoints with interactive charts and anomaly detection.
# Details:
1. Create a dedicated health monitoring page in `/app/health/page.tsx`
2. Implement a unified health status view that aggregates data from `/health`, `/health/database`, and `/health/database/metrics` endpoints
3. Create interactive system performance charts using Recharts with configurable time ranges
4. Implement basic anomaly detection logic to highlight unusual patterns
5. Add resource utilization trends with capacity planning recommendations
6. Create a health check history timeline
7. Implement detailed database metrics visualization
8. Add component-level health status indicators
9. Create a health status refresh mechanism with configurable intervals
10. Implement health status notifications using React Toast or similar
11. Add export functionality for health metrics data

# Test Strategy:
1. Test data aggregation from multiple health endpoints
2. Verify chart rendering with different data sets
3. Test anomaly detection with simulated abnormal data
4. Validate time range selection functionality
5. Test refresh mechanism at different intervals
6. Verify export functionality for metrics data
7. Test responsive behavior of charts and metrics

# Subtasks:
## 1. Unified Health Status View and Data Aggregation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive dashboard view that aggregates health metrics from all system components into a unified interface.
### Details:
Implement data collection services to fetch metrics from various system endpoints (servers, services, databases). Create a data processing pipeline that normalizes and aggregates metrics into consistent formats. Design a high-level status panel showing overall system health with color-coded indicators (green/yellow/red). Include a service dependency map visualization. Use React for frontend components and Redux for state management. Implement WebSocket connections for real-time data updates. Ensure data refresh rates are configurable (5s, 30s, 1m intervals).

## 2. Interactive Performance Charts with Time Range Selection [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create interactive visualization components that display performance metrics with customizable time ranges and granularity.
### Details:
Implement time-series charts using D3.js or Chart.js with zoom/pan capabilities. Create time range selector component with presets (last hour, day, week, month) and custom range picker. Develop data sampling logic to optimize performance for different time ranges (higher resolution for shorter ranges). Implement client-side caching to improve responsiveness. Add tooltips showing detailed metrics on hover. Create comparison views to overlay metrics from different time periods. Support for exporting chart data in CSV format.

## 3. Anomaly Detection Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Develop and integrate anomaly detection algorithms to automatically identify unusual patterns or deviations in system metrics.
### Details:
Implement statistical anomaly detection algorithms (Z-score, DBSCAN, or isolation forests). Create a configuration interface for setting detection thresholds and sensitivity. Develop a backend service for processing historical data to establish baselines. Implement real-time anomaly checking against established baselines. Design visual indicators for anomalies on charts and dashboards. Create an anomaly log/history view with filtering capabilities. Implement notification triggers when anomalies are detected. Use Python with scikit-learn for backend processing and REST APIs for frontend integration.

## 4. Resource Utilization and Database Metrics Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Create specialized visualization components for system resources (CPU, memory, disk, network) and database performance metrics.
### Details:
Develop resource utilization gauges and historical usage charts. Implement database-specific metrics panels (query performance, connection pools, cache hit ratios). Create heat maps for visualizing resource usage patterns over time. Design drill-down capabilities from high-level metrics to detailed component views. Implement threshold indicators for critical resource levels. Create correlation views to identify relationships between different metrics. Use SVG-based visualizations for gauges and specialized charts. Implement data aggregation logic for different time granularities.

## 5. Notification and Export Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Implement a comprehensive notification system and data export capabilities for the health monitoring dashboard.
### Details:
Develop alert configuration UI for setting up notification rules based on thresholds or anomalies. Implement multiple notification channels (email, Slack, SMS, webhook). Create a notification history and management interface. Develop scheduled report generation functionality with customizable templates. Implement data export in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, PDF). Create an API endpoint for external systems to query health status. Design mobile-responsive notifications with appropriate urgency levels. Implement notification grouping to prevent alert storms during major incidents. Use a message queue system (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for reliable notification delivery.
