# Task ID: 9
# Title: RAG Configuration Management Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a form-based RAG configuration creation and management interface with validation, testing, and version tracking.
# Details:
1. Create RAG configuration management page in `/app/configurations/page.tsx`
2. Implement configuration list component with key details
3. Create configuration detail view in `/app/configurations/[id]/page.tsx`
4. Implement form-based RAG configuration creation with validation using `/rag/config` endpoint
5. Add configuration viewing and management via `/rag/config/{config_id}`
6. Create configuration testing and validation functionality
7. Implement configuration history and version tracking
8. Add configuration duplication functionality
9. Create configuration export/import capabilities
10. Implement configuration search and filtering
11. Add configuration comparison tool
12. Create configuration usage analytics

# Test Strategy:
1. Test configuration creation with various parameters
2. Verify configuration validation functionality
3. Test configuration testing with sample data
4. Validate configuration history and version tracking
5. Test configuration duplication functionality
6. Verify configuration export/import capabilities
7. Test configuration search and filtering
8. Validate configuration comparison tool

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configuration List and Detail Views [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the UI components for displaying RAG configurations in both list and detailed views.
### Details:
Create a responsive table view showing all configurations with columns for name, creation date, last modified date, status, and actions. Implement filtering, sorting, and pagination. For the detail view, create a comprehensive layout displaying all configuration parameters organized in logical sections (data sources, embedding models, retrieval settings, etc.). Include a sidebar navigation for quick access to different sections of the configuration. Use React components with TypeScript interfaces for all configuration data models. Implement API integration with proper loading states and error handling.

## 2. Form-based Configuration Creation with Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop a multi-step form interface for creating and editing RAG configurations with comprehensive validation.
### Details:
Implement a wizard-style form with steps for: 1) Basic information (name, description), 2) Data source selection, 3) Embedding model configuration, 4) Retrieval settings, 5) Generation parameters. Use Formik or React Hook Form for form state management. Implement validation rules: required fields, format validation for URLs and API keys, numerical range validation for parameters like chunk size and top-k values. Add real-time validation feedback with clear error messages. Include conditional form fields that appear based on previous selections. Implement form persistence to prevent data loss during navigation.

## 3. Configuration Testing and Validation Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create an interface for testing RAG configurations with sample queries and visualizing results.
### Details:
Implement a testing panel allowing users to input sample queries and view the complete RAG pipeline results. Display intermediate results including: retrieved documents with relevance scores, embedding visualizations, and final generated responses. Add functionality to save test queries and results for future reference. Implement integration with backend validation API endpoints that perform configuration syntax checking and parameter validation. Create visual indicators for performance metrics (latency, token usage, etc.). Include a debug mode showing detailed logs of the RAG process steps.

## 4. Version Tracking and History Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Implement version control features for RAG configurations with history tracking and rollback capabilities.
### Details:
Create a version history view showing all changes to a configuration over time with timestamps and user information. Implement diff visualization to highlight changes between versions. Add functionality to restore previous versions with confirmation dialogs. Implement version tagging and naming for important releases. Create an audit log showing who made changes and when. Design the UI to handle branching versions if supported by the backend. Ensure proper API integration with version management endpoints including error handling for version conflicts.

## 5. Configuration Comparison and Analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Develop tools for comparing different RAG configurations and analyzing their performance metrics.
### Details:
Create a side-by-side comparison view for two or more configurations highlighting differences in parameters. Implement visualization components for performance metrics including: retrieval precision/recall, response quality scores, latency measurements, and token usage. Add functionality to run benchmark tests across multiple configurations with the same test queries. Create exportable reports of comparison results. Design interactive charts showing performance trends over time as configurations evolve. Implement tagging and categorization of configurations to organize them for comparison purposes.
