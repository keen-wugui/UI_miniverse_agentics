# Product Requirements Document: Agentic Workflow Dashboard

## Executive Summary

The Agentic Workflow Dashboard is an intelligent, web-based management interface that provides comprehensive visibility and control over business-specific RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows. Built on top of the existing Business-Specific RAG API, this dashboard enables users to monitor, configure, and optimize document processing pipelines, RAG configurations, and automated workflows through an intuitive, AI-powered interface.

## 1. Problem Statement

Organizations implementing RAG systems face several critical challenges:

- **Operational Complexity**: Managing document ingestion, processing status, and workflow execution across multiple collections requires technical expertise
- **Limited Visibility**: Current API-only interface provides no visual insights into system performance, document processing health, or workflow execution patterns
- **Manual Configuration**: Setting up and optimizing RAG configurations requires direct API interaction and technical knowledge
- **Reactive Monitoring**: No proactive alerts or intelligent recommendations for system optimization
- **Fragmented Workflows**: Business users cannot easily orchestrate complex, multi-step document processing and analysis workflows

## 2. Product Vision

Create an intelligent dashboard that transforms complex RAG operations into an accessible, visual experience where business users can:

- Monitor system health and performance through real-time analytics
- Configure and optimize RAG workflows using AI-powered recommendations
- Orchestrate sophisticated document processing pipelines without technical expertise
- Receive proactive insights and automated optimizations for improved performance

## 3. Target Users
